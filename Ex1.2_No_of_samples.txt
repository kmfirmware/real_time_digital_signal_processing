Exercise 1.2 - No. of Samples
Chapter 1, Exercise 1.2 - No. of Samples
Post your solution in this forum.  Does your answer for the audio CD conform to what we know about audio CD capacity?
The number of samples required for a given sample rate can be determined by multiplying the frequency by the desired duration. Frequency is given in samples per second (Hz).

A) 8kHz * 50ms = 400 samples

B) 16kHz * 50ms = 800 samples

C) 44.1kHz * 50ms = 2205 samples

D) 48kHz * 50ms = 2400 samples

CDs commonly hold 700MB of data.  To determine the number of minutes a CD can hold, we assume a sample rate of 44.1kHz. We also assume stereo sound using two channels with 16bits per sample per channel.
