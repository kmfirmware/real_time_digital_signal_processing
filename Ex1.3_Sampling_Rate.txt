Exercise 1.3 - Sampling Rate

Chapter 1, exercise 1.3 - Sampling rate & Number of bits
Post your solution in this thread. 
Using the 6.02dB per bit approximation for dynamic range, 17bits are required to have a dynamic range of at least 100dB (6.02*17=102.34dB).  Based on Shannon's sampling theorem, the minimum sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency (20kHz), so the minimum sampling rate is 40kHz. CDs are commonly sampled at 44.1 kHz (slightly oversampled assuming the maximum frequency humans can hear is 20kHz) using 16bits (6.02*16=96.32dB).

To store one minute of music sampled at 44.1 kHz using a 16bit converter requires 42.336 Mbits of data.

44.1kHz * 60s = 2646000 samples per minute
2646000 samples per minute * 16bits per sample = 42336000 bits
